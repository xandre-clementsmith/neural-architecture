- Characterized by significant connectivity, non-specific function, and non-uniform structure (unlike neocortex)
- Highly connected to [[Memory Nervous System]] and typically inclusive of it - this page will refer to the limbic system as the evaluative component, and not the memory component
- Includes ventral component of [[Basal Ganglia Nervous System]]
- Anticipate [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]] is critical for primate classical conditioning, and the [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]] is critical for primary operant conditioning
