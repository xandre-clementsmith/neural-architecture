- Characterized by significant connectivity, non-specific function, and non-uniform structure (unlike neocortex)
- Highly connected to [[Declarative Memory Nervous System]] and typically inclusive of it - this page will refer to the limbic system as the evaluative component, and not the memory component
- Includes ventral component of [[Basal Ganglia Nervous System]]
- Per https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/10/3/206/449565, [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]] resolves sensory components of reward, and [[Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex]] resolves intrinsic\interoceptive components of reward
- Anticipate [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]] is critical for primate classical conditioning, and the [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]] is critical for primary operant conditioning

- Neurobiological sources for endogenous opioid ligands in NAc include dynorphin (kappa ligand) released from medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express D1 receptors, and enkephalin (delta and mu ligand) from D2-expressing MSNs ([Ghazarossian et al., 1980](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-19); [Raynor et al., 1994](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-57)). Dynorphin and enkephalin are also released by input projections from other structures, including ventral pallidum and lateral hypothalamus ([Haber et al., 1985](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-28); [Peyron et al., 1998](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-54); [Groenewegen et al., 1999](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-25); [Baldo et al., 2003](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-3)). In addition, Î²-endorphin (potent mu ligand) may reach NAc medial shell via projections from the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus ([Khachaturian et al., 1984](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-35); [Raynor et al., 1994](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4239#ref-57)).
