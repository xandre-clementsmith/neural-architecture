##### General Information
- Motivated behavior can be grouped sequentially into
	- Initiation
	- Procurement
	- Consummatory
- Basic classes include
	- Ingestive
	- Reproductive
	- Defensive
- Cortical Projections
	- Isocortex (Excitatory)
		- Glutamate projection to the brainstem ([[Internal Capsule]]) and spinal cord motor system ([['Corticospinal Tract]])
		- Glutamate collateral to the striatum (Corticostriatal)
	- Striatum (Inhibitory)
		- GABA projection to the brainstem motor system
		- GABA collateral to the pallidum (Striatopallidal Fibres)
	- Pallidum (Disinhibitory)
		- GABA projection to the brainstem motor system
		- GABA collateral to the thalamus

##### Contrast to Exploratory / Foraging Behavior
- Exploratory behavior is not directed to a direct goal
- Is foraging behavior not motivated / goal-directed behavior?
