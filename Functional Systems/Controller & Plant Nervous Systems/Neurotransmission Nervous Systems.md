# Downstream Signaling
### cAMP (Gs, Gi/o)
- PKA + Others
- Has a broad facilitatory/potentiating role
### DAG (Gq)
- PKC + Others
- Leans potentiating, but can be inhibitory (context-dependent)
### IP3 Calcium (Gq)
- Intracellular Calcium (Not at synapse)
- Can be potentiating or inhibitory
# Ions
Na+
- Depolarization phase of action potential
- Neurotransmitters leverage Na+ gradient
- Drives amino acid uptake for protein synthesis
- Maintains intracellular pH along with H+
- Helps control cell volume through osmotic effects
K+
- Maintains -70mV resting membrane potential
- Repolarization and hyperpolarization phase of action potential
- Reduces neurotransmitter release
- Maintains cell volume with Cl- and Na+
Cl-
- Neuron hyperpolarizes neurons when GABA_A or glycine receptors open, enabling GABA and glycine inhibitory function
- Makes developing GABA neurons excitatory instead of inhibitory until fully developed
- Modulates conductance and resting potential for gain control, timing precision, and preventing runaway excitation
Ca2+
- Triggers synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release
- Flows through both NMDA receptors postsynaptically and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels presynaptically
- Critical for long-term potentiation and long-term depression
- Activates transcription factors (e.g. CREB) for gene expression regulation
- Ca2+-dependent enzymes (kinases, phosphatases, proteases) and proteins (calmodulin)
- Regulates enzymes involved in in making neurotransmitters
- Regulates ATP production
Mg2+
- Voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptors, contributing to LTP/LTD
	- Either triggered by multiple neurons combining to be able to depolarize the neuron, a single neuron spiking frequently, or back-propagating spikes
	- Voltage-dependence is proportional, not all-or-nothing like action potentials
- Enables Ca2+ to enter the neuron
