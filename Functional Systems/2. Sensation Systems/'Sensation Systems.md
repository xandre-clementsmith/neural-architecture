# Direct Sensation Pathways
### General Exteroceptive: 
Outward-Facing Touch
- [['Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus System]] (DCML) - Exteroception (Fine Touch, Vibration, Two-Point Discrimination, Proprioception)
- General Somatic Cerebellar Tracts
	- [['Spinocerebellar Tracts]]
	- [[Cuneocerebellar Tract]]
	- [[Spino-Olivary Tract]]
- [[Trigeminal Sensory Nuclei]] - Face. Needs more clarity
### General Interoceptive: 
Temperature, Pain, Internal Sensation
- Anterolateral System
	- [['Spinothalamic Tract]] (STT): 
		- [['Lateral Spinothalamic Tract]]: Nociception, Temperature, C-Tactile Afferent
		- [[Anterior Spinothalamic Tract]]: Crude Touch, Pressure
	- [[Spinoreticular Tract]]: Alertness and Arousal
	- [[Spinotectal Tract]]: Orients head and eyes towards stimulus. Terminates in [[Superior Colliculus]] and [[Inferior Colliculus]]
- [[CN X]]
- [['CN IX]]
- Circumventricular Organs: Blood-brain sensory transduction via the subfornical organ, [[Subcommissural Organ]], [[Area Postrema]], [[Vascular Organ of Lamina Terminalis]], [[Median Eminence]], pituitary neural lobe, and pineal gland.
- [[Trigeminal Sensory Nuclei]] - Face? Needs more clarity
### Special Exteroceptive:
- [[Retinal Sensation System]] via CN II
	- Primary Processing
	- Reflexive Processing
- [[Cochlear Sensation System]] via CN VIII
- [[Vestibular Sensation System]] via CN VIII
### Special Interoceptive:
- [[Olfactory Sensation System]] via CN I
- [[Gustatory Sensation System]] via VII, IX, and X

|**Examples**|Touch, pain, temperature, proprioception, pressure|Vision, hearing, balance, smell, taste|
|**Consciousness**|Often conscious but can be subconscious|Always conscious (by nature of what they detect)
