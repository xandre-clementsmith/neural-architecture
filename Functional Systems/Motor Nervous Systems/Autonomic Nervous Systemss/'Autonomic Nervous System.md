# Sympathetic

- Sensory Component: Lamina I fibers via [['Spinothalamic Tract]] (Lateral)

### Central Control of the Autonomic Nervous System & Thermoregulation

![[Pasted image 20240210225941.png]]

Control of autonomic system is managed by [['Paraventricular Hypothalamus]]

[[Reticulospinal Tracts]] carry fibers to ganglia
### Connectivity

- Pre and postganglia via paravertebral ganglia; inputs are received in decreasing order of quantity: 
	- C1 adrenergic cell group, 5-HT raphe complex, A5 noradrenergic cell group
	- Ventral medulla
	- PVN (Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus)
	- Lateral Hypothalamic Area
- Extra-hypothalamic sites are associated with sympathetic control
	- Norepinephrine-containing neurons of the dorsal mesencephalon (locus ceruleus), the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla (the A5 and A1 regions), and the serotonin-containing neurons of the pontine and medullary raphe nuclei

Major Pathways
- Dorsal Longitudinal Fasciculus (DLF)
	- PVN -> Mesencephalic Reticular Formation, Periaqueductal Gray, Parabrachial Nucleus, Locus Ceruleus, Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, Nucleus Ambiguous, and Medullary Raphe -> Intermediolateral Spinal Cord
- Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB)
	- Septal Nuclei, Basal Forebrain Inputs
	- Solitary Tract inputs
	- Amygdala, Hippocampus -> Stria Terminalis, Ventral Amygdalofugal Pathway, Fornix -> MFB -> PVN -> DLF efferents
- Mammillotegmental Tract
	- Projects into mesecephalic and pontine reticular formation
# Parasympathetic

- Sensory Component: [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]] and [[Parabrachial Nucleus]] (for indirect NTS)
- TBD: [[Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus Nerve]], [[Nucleus Ambiguus]], [[Trigeminal Motor Nuclei]]

- CN III (Accommodation and Miosis), CN VII (Salvinary Glands, Lacrimal/Tear Glands, Nasal Glands), CN IX (Parotid Salivary Gland), and CN X
- Parasympathetic Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves (Spinal Cord)
- CNs are partly controlled by the [[Corticobulbar Tracts]] (M1)
