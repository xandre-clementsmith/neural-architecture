- Declarative Memory
- Based around the [['Hippocampal Formation]] and [['Septal Nuclei]] / [[Diagonal Band of Broca]] for episodic (also some semantic)
- Based around temporal lobe for semantic

- -> Precommissural [[Fornix]] (Septohippocampal) -> [[Medial Septal Nucleus]] - Gluatamatergic, GABAergic, Cholinergic
- Postcommissural [[Fornix]] (Subiculothalamic) - Glutamatergic
	- Direct: -> [['Anterodorsal Thalamus]]
	- Indirect: -> [['Mammillary Bodies]] -> [['Anterodorsal Thalamus]] (Primary)
	- Primarily glutamatergic

AI-Generated, Needs Validation:
Dorsal/Posterior: Spatial learning, memory, navigation -> Dorsal Subiculum -> Primarily postcommissural fornix
Ventral/Anterior: Limbic, stress, anxiety -> Ventral Subiculum -> Primarily precommissural fornix - need to validate postcommissural fornix component
