- There seems to be a hypothalamic-controlled system, implicating the reticular formation and periaqueductal gray
	- May include PPN, will return after reviewing neurotransmission systems

- [[Habenula]], [['Dorsal Tegmental Nucleus]], [[Interpeduncular Nucleus]]
- [[Periaqueductal Gray]]
### Reticular Activating System
- Both ascending (ARAS) and descending via the [[Reticulospinal Tracts]]
- Mesencephalic Locomotor Region potentially includes [[Pedunculopontine Nucleus]], [[Cuneiform Nucleus]], and [[Reticulospinal Tracts]] (Extrapyramidal Area)
