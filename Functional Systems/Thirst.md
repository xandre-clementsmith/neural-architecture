"Fig. 11. Outline of circuitry involved in controlling thirst and drinking behavior. The scheme focuses on one member of the behavior control column, the descending paraventricular nucleus (PVHd), and its major inputs (A) and outputs (B). As discussed in the text, various classes of input play a key role in the initiation phase of the behavior, whereas outputs of the PVH are involved in the procurement and consummatory phases of the behavior, as well as in coordinating the appropriate visceral (neuroendocrine and autonomic) responses to maintain homeostasis during these latter phases, before enough water is located and ingested. The PVHd is perhaps the best established component of the hypothalamic thirst control network, although there are almost certainly others, which remain obscure at this point. Interestingly, the PVHd is a critical component of the hypothalamic hunger control network as well.
