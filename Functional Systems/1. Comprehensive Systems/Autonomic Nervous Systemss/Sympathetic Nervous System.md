# Overview

# Sensation

1. [[Peripheral Nervous System]] (Splanchnic Nerves; Likely AÎ´ & C of Integumentary)
2. [[RL I]]
3. [['Lateral Spinothalamic Tract]]
	- Projects to [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]] via [[Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus Nerve]] (need to confirm) and [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]]
# Model
1. [[Parabrachial Nucleus]] <- Integration with [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]]
# Evaluator
- Either [[Parabrachial Nucleus]] or [[Periaqueductal Gray]] <- Conflicting information on localizing pleasure and pain across these two regions
- ? [[A1]] and [[A2]] direct to Hypothalamus (Not certain if neurotransmission is evaluator or controller)
- ? [['Limbic System]] - [['Amygdala]], [[Hippocampus Proper]], [[Septal Nuclei]], [['Cingulate Cortex]], [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]], [['Insular Lobe]], [[Perirhinal Cortex]]/[['Entorhinal Cortex]]
- ? May include components of hypothalamus as well?
# Controller
Ordered in rough order, but not necessarily sequential (each can receive direct from RL I and project directly back to RL I)
1. [[Periaqueductal Gray]] <- Behavioral control in response to stressors
2. ? [[Paraventricular]] <- Receives inputs from [[Anterior]], [['Lateral Zone]], [[Mammillary Bodies]], Posterior [['Hypothalamus]]
3. [[A5]], [['A6 - Locus Coeruleus]], [[A7]] to Spinal Cord
# Plant
1. [[Medial Forebrain Bundle]] and [[Dorsal Longitudinal Fasciculus]]
2. Splanchnic Nerves of the [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
