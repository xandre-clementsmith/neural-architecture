[[Parvocellular Red Nucleus]] supports [[Cerebellar Nervous System]] climbing fibers and [[Magnocellular Red Nucleus]] supports [[Rubrospinal Tract]]
### Organization
- Subdivisions
	- Magnocellular Red Nucleus (mRN)
		- Rubrospinal System
		- Quickly receives cerebellar processed somatosensory along with motor regions of cortex
	- Parvocellular Red Nucleus (pRN)
		- Rubro-Olivo-Cerebellar System / Part of Cerebellar Error System ([[Inferior Olive]])

- Abundant brainstem red nucleus afferents are not described for simplification
- Includes rubrospinal area
- Primates have distinctive tracts (shown below), with much larger pRN than mRN, which deviates from other animals
