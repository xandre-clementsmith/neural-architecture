- Subdivisions
	- Magnocellular Red Nucleus (mRN)
		- Rubrospinal System
		- Quickly receives cerebellar processed somatosensory along with motor regions of cortex
		- Afferents:
			- [[*Interposed Nucleus]]: Spinal somatosensory (contextual mossy fibers) via [[Superior Cerebellar Peduncle]] and directly
			- Cortical via VA and VL nuclei of Thalamus
		- Efferents: 
			- [[Rubrospinal Tract]] 
	- Parvocellular Red Nucleus (pRN)
		- Rubro-Olivo-Cerebellar System / Part of Cerebellar Error System ([[Inferior Olive]])
		- Afferents:
			- Motor Cortical: [[Motor Cortex (M1)]], [[Supplementary Eye Field]], and [[Frontal Eye Field]]
			- [[Dentate Nucleus|Dentate Nucleus]]
		- Efferents
			- [[Inferior Olive]] via Rubro-Olivary Pathway
				- Cerebellar Cortex
				- Dentate Nucleus to inhibit further IO activity
- Afferents
	- Contralateral [[Superior Cerebellar Peduncle]]
	- Ipsilateral Motor Cortex
- Efferents
	- In humans, majority goes through medial tegmental field towards inferior olive to form [[Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle]]
	- [[Rubrospinal Tract]], appears less essential to humans

Red Nucleus for innate movements?
- Major changes in RN cytoarchitecture and connectivity coincide with major changes in motor behavior, and in particular in locomotion patterns
