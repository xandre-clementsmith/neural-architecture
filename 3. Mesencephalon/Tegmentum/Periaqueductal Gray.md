- Behavioral control center for responding to internal (pain) and external (threat) stressors centered around sympathetic and parasympathetic systems with close coupling to limbic cortical regions and hypothalamus
- Implicated in pain, sympathetic response, and defensive and aversive behaviors
- Utilizes glutamate, GABA, opioids (enkephalin), substance P, neurotensin, and others; dorsolateral also expresses NADPH-diaphorase and synthesizes nitric oxide; ventrolateral contains dopamine [[Aaq]]
- Includes Nucleus of Darkschewitsch for eye moving controlling
- Separated into dorsomedial, dorsolateral, lateral, ventrolateral
- May be source of valence (PAG stimulation in awake humans can produce reports of intense emotional feelings of either positive or negative valence, including euphoria or horror. [Boccard et al., 2013; Tasker, 1982])

Lamina I terminations in the periaqueductal gray (upper brainstem). The last lamina I
termination site in the upper brainstem (including the mesencephalon) is the
periaqueductal gray (PAG). The PAG mediates and coordinates motor, autonomic, and other physiological activity for a wide range of stereotypical and
species-specific adaptive behaviors that are critical for the survival of the individual organism and the species. It constitutes the highest brainstem component
in the central autonomic hierarchy; it receives descending inputs from forebrain
central autonomic/emotional (“limbic”) motor structures, including the behavioral control columns for motivated behaviors in the hypothalamus, the autonomic and behavioral centers of the amygdala and extended amygdala, and the
emotional behavioral outputs of the cingulate motor cortex and the entorhinal
cortex. In turn, the PAG has descending connections to all of the brainstem preautonomic output regions previously mentioned (such as the rostral VLM and
RVMM), as well as to the complex premotor reticular networks for all bulbar
motor output systems and for descending spinal motor-control networks. It coordinates the actions of cardiorespiratory and autonomic functions with skeletal
motor systems in the most simple stereotypical behaviors critical for survival
(what an ethologist calls “fixed action patterns”). The PAG is vital for the control
of cardiovascular, respiratory, thermoregulatory, elimination (defecation and
micturition), and reproductive systems; it is vital as well for grooming and affiliative behaviors, aggressive and defensive behaviors (fight or flight), recuperative
behaviors and feeding behaviors, all of which are normally guided by the hypothalamus. It is crucial for species-specific vocalization (see below) and the contextually appropriate breathing patterns that are required for vocalization. It is
responsible for prioritized switching between competing behaviors by “gating”
motor outputs on and off. Some authors suggest that it organizes responses to
stress, and other authors regard it as the seat of consciousness. However, all
available evidence (including the comparative evidence summarized here and
the imaging evidence in the two reviews cited below) is consistent with the perinteroCePtion and homeostasis •• 125
spective that it organizes homeostatic motor output, providing coordinated control of both the striated/behavioral and the smooth/autonomic motor systems
and is not a sensory substrate; for example, one well-designed functional magnetic resonance imaging study in awake humans showed that the PAG mediated
the effect of cardiac timing on emotional appraisal (in medial orbitofrontal cortex) and that the PAG was significantly negatively correlated with the feeling of
emotional intensity (disgust) reported by the participants. Specific portions of the
PAG are interconnected with a few particular subregions of the PB, and together,
the PB and PAG can be viewed as complementary sensory and motor regions,
respectively. [Drake et al., 2010; Oka et al., 2008; Usonoff et al., 2009; Yoshida
