- Primarily carries non-oculomotor cranial nerve information from motor cortex to head and face

### Afferents
- [[Motor Cortex (M1)]]
- [['Premotor Cortex]]
- [[Supplementary Motor Area]]

- Passes through corona radiata, genu of the internal capsule, peduncle of the cerebrum, base of the pons, and to the medullary pyramid
- Then synapse at motor nuclri of cranial nerve nuclei
### Efferents
- Trigeminal [['CN V|'CN V]]
- Facial [[Inferior Salivatory Nucleus|Inferior Salivatory Nucleus]]
