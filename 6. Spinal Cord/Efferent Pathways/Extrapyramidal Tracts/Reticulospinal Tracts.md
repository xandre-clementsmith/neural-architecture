- Originate in brainstem reticular formation
- Major alternative to corticospinal tract
- Locomotion and postural control
- Gross rather than fine control
- Arise in the medial part of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the caudal rhombencephalon

- Made of medial/pontine and lateral/medullary tracts
- Includes Sympathetic Component of [['Autonomic Nervous System]]
	- We do not fully grasp the division between autonomic and somatic reticular systems (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468867319300288)
- Does not appear to directly receive cerebellar inputs

### Afferents
- [['(Pontine) Reticular Formation]]
- [[Medullary Reticular Formation]]
