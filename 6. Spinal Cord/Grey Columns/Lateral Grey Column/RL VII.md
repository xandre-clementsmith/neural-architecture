- [[Sympathetic Nervous System]], receiving inputs from brain stem, organs, and hypothalamus
- Only present in thoracic and upper lumbar
- Includes posterior thoracic nucleus (Clarke's Column)
- Includes central cervical nucleus https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123742452000061 and lateral cervical nucleus https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25079

**The Intermediomedial Nucleus** (IMM) is located throughout the spinal cord (Rexed, 1954; Veshchitskii et al., 2022). Depending on the segment, IMM is situated dorsolaterally, laterally, or ventrolaterally relative to the central canal on the border between lamina VII and X (Fig. 1) (Tan et al., 2023). It consists of small to medium triangular neurons (Sengul, 2015). The IMM is responsible for the convergence of afferents from internal organs and for the inhibition of another visceral nucleus, the intermediolateral (see below), thus providing modulation of the functions of internal organs (Tan et al., 2023). [PV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/parvalbumin "Learn more about PV from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") expression in the IMM has been described only in one study in primates (Rausell et al., 1992). However, the presented figure is unconvincing because the location of the area containing dark PV neuropile more resembles the CCN both in its size and the dark PV + [staining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/staining-technique "Learn more about staining from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") previously documented in other mammals (Celio, 1990; Ren and Ruda, 1994; Fu et al., 2012).

**The Intermediolateral Nucleus** (IML) is localized in the lateral horns of the gray matter (in the most dorsolateral region of lamina VII) of thoracic and rostral lumbar segments (Fig. 1) (Watson et al., 2009; Sengul et al., 2013; Veshchitskii et al., 2022) and contains sympathetic preganglionic cells controlling the state of internal organs and blood vessels (Deuchars and Lall, 2015). No PV staining has been revealed within the IML in any species studied (rats: Antal et al., 1990; cats: Veshchitskii et al., 2022; humans: Satoh et al., 1991).
