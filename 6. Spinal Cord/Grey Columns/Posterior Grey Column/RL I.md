- Primarily interneurons for pain and temperature
- Innervates:
	- Caudal Ventrolateral Medulla (CVLM): Nociceptive and cardiovascular response
	- Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS): Cardio-respiratory inputs and noxious stimulation for reflex tachycardia
	- Lateral Parabrachial Area (LPb): Projects to amygdala and hypothalamus for emotional response to pain
	- Periaqueductal Grey Matter (PAG): Develops ways to deal with pain and main target for analgesics
	- Thalamus: Sensory and motivational aspects of pain

- NS: Nociceptive-Specific (AÎ´) - Sharp pricking pain
- HPC: Heat, Pinch, Cold / Polymodal Nociceptive Cells (C) - Slow burning pain
- COOL: Cool-Sensitive Thermoreceptive Cells
