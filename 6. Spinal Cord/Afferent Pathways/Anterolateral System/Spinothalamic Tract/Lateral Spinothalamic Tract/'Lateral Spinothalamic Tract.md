- Information: Pain, Temperature, C-Tactile Afferents
- NS with sharp, pricking pain, COOL with innocuous cool, and HPC with burning pain. In addition, other distinct types of lamina I neurons convey sensory activity that specifically corresponds with the distinct feelings of warmth, itch, affective (sensual) touch, muscle ache and burn, and toothache, as well as (putatively) with bladder urgency, colonic pressure, cardiac pain, vasomotor flush, and so on
- MDvc = [[Mediodorsal Nucleus]]
- VMpo + VMb = [[Ventroanterior Nucleus]] 
- Sympathetic-related sensory-component of ANS

From A.D. Craig
The dense noradrenergic input that A1 provides to the extended amygdala
(specifically, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) bilaterally has been directly
associated with behavior interpreted as “pain affect” in rats. This is a very important pathway. We think of the affective component of pain as the unpleasantness,
the “hurt,” whereas in rodents the word “affect” is used operationally to mean a
behavioral motivation, not a feeling. In experimental animals we can measure
the negative motivational component of a noxious stimulus in a conditioned
place association, by comparison to a strongly aversive standard, such as bitter
quinine or a bright light. If the processing in the portion of the extended amygdala that receives A1 input is interrupted, a rat will not learn or retain learned
behavior conditioned by a noxious stimulus; in other words, the motivational
value of the noxious stimulus is reduced or eliminated. This pathway is very similar to the sensorimotor pathway that underlies salt-seeking behavior, another
homeostatic emotional behavior (see below). Evidence suggests that catecholamines in the extended amygdala modulate both aversive and incentive behavior. A1 cells also project to the central amygdala, which is associated with autonomic control. [Woulfe et al., 1990; Deyama et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2008, 2011;
