### Definitions
- Action (*a* ϵ A): A signal that results in attempted optimization
- Command and Control (C2)
	- Command: In the context of C2, Command is an overarching action α
	- Control: In the context of C2, Control refers to the nested controllers that carry out Command α
- Communication: Exchange of information 
- Controller: Maps states and/or rewards to actions
	- Automatic Control: *s*-*a* mappings
	- Goal-Directed Control: *r*-*a* and *r*/*s*-*a* mappings
- Environment: Maps events to events, inclusive of actuation-based events
- Evaluator: Maps states to reward
- Event (*e* ϵ E): A moment of all phenomenon not defined as a state, reward, or action for a given system
- Information: Representation of structure
- Model: Maps states to states. Inclusive of information from model, sensation, evaluator, and controller
- Plant: Maps actions to actuations bounded by events. Combination of process and actuation
- Reward (*r* ϵ R): A value indicating the optimality of a state
- Sensation: Measures events and maps them to states
- State (*s* ϵ S): Information. Can be sensation-derived or intrinsic

##### Complexity
src:
alt names:
- Complexity: System measurement quantifying components and connections
	- Connection complexity can be measured by mathematical equation (linear vs nonlinear)
##### Control
src: precision
alt names: 
- Control:
##### Dimensions
src:
alt names: degrees of freedom
- Dimensions: Independent coordinates for defining the position of a point
	- Our day-to-day primarily consists of three spatial dimensions, and a temporal dimension
##### Entropy
src: https://shorturl.at/7d004 (LibreTexts Chemistry)
alt names: Boltzmann's entropy formula
- Entropy: Measure of the number of possible microscopic states of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties
	- Microstates describe particle position and momentum
	- Macrostates describe total energy, volume, pressure, temperature, ...
##### Optimization
src: https://www.britannica.com/science/optimization
alt names: mathematical programming
- Optimization problems typically have three fundamental elements:
	- Objective Function: Single numerical quantity that is to be maximized or minimized
	- Independent Variables: Set of variables that can be manipulated to optimize the objective
	- Constraints: Restrictions on the values that the independent variables can take
##### Organization
src:
alt names:
- Organization: Description of complexity at  specific dimensions
##### Information
src: 
alt names: 
- Information: Description of complexity/organization; reduces uncertainty
##### Additional Definitions
- Cybernetics: Control and communication commanded by an agent; art of steersmanship
