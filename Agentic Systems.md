### Definitions
- Action (*a* ϵ A): A signal that results in attempted optimization
- Command and Control (C2)
	- Command: In the context of C2, Command is an overarching action α
	- Control: In the context of C2, Control refers to the nested controllers that carry out Command α
- Communication: Exchange of information 
- Complexity: A measure quantifying the amount of information needed for representation
- Controller: Maps states and/or rewards to actions
	- Automatic Control: *s*-*a* mappings
	- Goal-Directed Control: *r*-*a* and *r*/*s*-*a* mappings
- Cybernetics: Study of feedback
- Entropy: A measure comparing the number of possible microscopic states of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties
- Environment: Maps events to events, inclusive of actuation-based events
- Evaluator: Maps states to reward
- Event (*e* ϵ E): A moment of all phenomenon not defined as a state, reward, or action for a given system
- Information: Representation of structure
- Model: Maps states to states. Inclusive of information from model, sensation, evaluator, and controller
- Plant: Maps actions to actuations bounded by events. Combination of process and actuation
- Reward (*r* ϵ R): A value indicating the optimality of a state
- Sensation: Measures events and maps them to states
- State (*s* ϵ S): Information. Can be sensation-derived or intrinsic
