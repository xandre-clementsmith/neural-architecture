##### What are the constituent parts of AI, and what makes them unsafe?

Network-Based Approach
- Data / World Model / Sensory Systems
- Motor System
- Cognitive Networks
	- Attention System
	- Default / Memory System
	- Salience System ? 
	- Executive System

Agent-Based Approach
- World Model
	- Based on external "inputs" / sensation
	- Occipital, Parietal, and Temporal
	- Generative AI
- Driving Force
	- Driving circuits of brainstem and hypothalamus
	- Insular? Limbic circuitry? Amygdala? NAc?
	- Reward error (RPE vs Prior?)

- Planning & Executive
	- Frontal Cortex
	- Insular? Dorsal striatum?
	- Driven by dopamine signal
	- Reinforcement Learning / Optimization
	- Adaptability; benefits most strongly from "continual/lifelong learning"

##### What are the inputs and outputs that are dangerous?
- LLMs and Nuclear War: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03408
- Inputs: What data is used to train?
- Outputs: What actuators are available to the model? Including humans that can be persuaded. Which outcomes are the most dangerous to human life (biological, chemical, nuclear, etc)

##### What is the general framework for AI that is method-agnostic?
- Cannot be based on GPTs, or specific hebbian implementations
