- [[Medullary Reticular Formation]] and [[Mesencephalic Reticular Formation]] redirect here for convenience
- Primarily consists of interneurons, includes excitatory interneurons
- Function: Arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycles, coordination of somatic motor movements, cardiovscular and respiratory control, pain modulation, and habituation
- Network: medial RF is small-world, not scale-free / exponential (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2005.3354)
- Reticular Formation and its connectivity makes up the Reticular Activating System (RAS)
- Highly stereotyped suggesting strong underlying genetic organization (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2013.00007/full)

General Connectivity
- Efferents
	- [['Intralaminar Formation]] of the Thalamus
	- [[Reticulospinal Tracts]] for both [['Somatic Systems]] and [[Autonomic System]]
	- [['Cerebellum]]: Includes both [[Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle]] (errors) and [[Middle Cerebellar Peduncle]] (parallel fibers)
- Afferents
	- [[Spinoreticular Tract]]
	- [[Corticobulbar Tracts]]
	- [[Fastigial Nucleus]] via [[Superior Cerebellar Peduncle]]
	- [['Hypothalamus]]
- Short local connections to cranial nerve reflexes, central pattern generators (brainstem), cerebellum input & output, and gaze centers within the brainstem
- Long connections
	- Mesencephalic and rostral pontine RF modulates forebrain activity
	- Medullary and caudal pontine RF modulates somatic and visceral motor activity ([[Reticulospinal Tracts]])
