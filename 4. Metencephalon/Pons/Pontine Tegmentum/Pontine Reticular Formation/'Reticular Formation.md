- [[Medullary Reticular Formation]] and Mesencephalic RF are included here for convenience
- Primarily consists of interneurons, includes excitatory interneurons
- Function: Arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycles, coordination of somatic motor movements, cardiovascular and respiratory control, pain modulation, and habituation
- Network: medial RF is small-world, not scale-free / exponential (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2005.3354)
- Reticular Formation and its connectivity makes up the Reticular Activating System (RAS)
- Highly stereotyped suggesting strong underlying genetic organization (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2013.00007/full)

General Connectivity

The median column extends throughout the medulla,
pons and midbrain occupying the paramedian zones.
Collectively they constitute the raphe nuclei and many
neurons are serotoninergic. It consists of the following
nuclei:
• Nuclei raphes pallidus and obscurus: lie in the
upper 2/3 of the medulla crossing the ponto-
medullary junction.
• Nucleus raphe magnus: lies partly overlapping the
above two nuclei and ascending into the pons.
• Pontine raphe nucleus: lies in the pons above the
raphe magnus nucleus.
• Central Superior raphe nucleus: located in the pons.
• Dorsal mesencephalic raphe nucleus: extends
throughout the midbrain, expanding cranially and
narrowing caudally. (Williams et al; 1999).
The medial column consists of the following nuclei:
• Central nucleus of medulla oblongata: a thin
lamina lateral to raphe nuclei in the lower medulla.
• Gigantocellular nucleus: consists of medullary and
pontine parts.
• Caudal and oral pontine tegmental reticular nuclei:
lie within the tegmentum of pons.
• Cuneiform and subcuneiform nuclei: lie in the
midbrain tegmentum.
The lateral column consists of the following nuclei:
• Parvocellular reticular area: lies in the upper
medulla and lower lateral pontine tegmentum.
• Superficial ventrolateral reticular area: lying in
both medulla and pons.
• Lateral pontine tegmental reticular area: forming
the medial and lateral parabranchial nuclei.
• Noradrenergic cell groups: the most important one
is the locus ceruleus which lies in the tegmentum
of the pons and it functions as an attention centre
focusing neural functions to the prevailing needs of
the alert person.
• Adrenergic cell groups: lying rostral to
noradrenergic group and it function as centre of
vasomotor control.
• Cholinergic cell group: lying in the
pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of the
mesencephalic tegmental reticular zone.
