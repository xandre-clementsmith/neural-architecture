### General
- PPN is present in virtually all vertebrate species; it is identified by its population of cholinergic neurons
- Composed of cholinergic (~3000 in rat PPN), GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons
- Cholinergic neurons form a continuum from caudal end of substantia nigra (rostral part of PPN), and ending at caudal end of LDT [[Laterodorsal Tegmental Nucleus]]
### Cholinergic Neurons
- Cholinergic neurons are fewest rostrally, and increase gradually caudally
- Brainstem acetylcholine origin alongside LDT (Collectively known as the meso-pontine tegmental area)
	- Basal forebrain is the origin for acetylcholine in the forebrain
- Cholinergic axons give rise to an average of five collaterals, the majority of which have an ascending trajectory with a dorsal and ventral stream
	- Ascending ventral innervates parts of midbrain basal ganglia and continues to hypothalamic region in the basal forebrain
- Ascending projections may promote goal-directed locomotion by increasing dopamine neuron activity
### Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons
- GABAergic neurons are densely concentrated in the rostral PPN, forming a contiuum with GABAergic neurons of the [[Substantia Nigra pars reticular]] (SNr) and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (tail of [[A10 - Ventral Tegmental Area]])
- Glutamatergic neurons are more caudal and extend dorsally into the [[Cuneiform Nucleus]]
### Motor System
- Potentially part of the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR), but spinally projecting non-cholinergic neurons surrounding PPN may be mostly responsible for inducing locomotion
- Includes cholinergic and putative glutamatergic components
- Innervate Rostral/Oral and Caudal Pontine [['(Pontine) Reticular Formation]] (Medial Group: Motor Coordination), Gigantocellular Nucleus (Medial Group: Motor Coordination), and [['Spinal Cord]]
- Only a small proportion of PPN neurons have descending projections, and these are mainly non-cholinergic
- Cholinergic output inhibits movement and reduces muscle tone, whereas glutamatergic induces movement and increases muscle tone
### Dopaminergic Modulation
- Rostral PPN innervates SNc, caudal PPN innervates SNc and VTA, and LDT innervates VTA (predominantly)
	- Cholinergic, Glutamergic, GABAergic
	- Efferents to dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic midbrain neurons
	- Only cholinergic input to midbrain dopamine region
- PPN and LDT innervate distinct subsets with distinct connectivity and functional properties

- One neuron innervates most of the ascending and descending pathways; however, rostral cholinergic neurons predominately innervate motor structures (SNc and dorsolateral striatum), whereas caudal portions innervate limbic structures (VTA and dorsomedial striatum)
	- Topographical organization resembles lateral-to-medial functional segregation of motor and limbic circuits
