##### General
- PPN is present in virtually all vertebrate species; it is identified by its population of cholinergic neurons
- Composed of cholinergic (~3000 in rat PPN), GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons
##### Cholinergic Neurons
- Cholinergic neurons are fewest rostrally, and increase gradually caudally
- Brainstem acetylcholine origin alongside [[Laterodorsal Tegmental Nucleus]] (Collectively known as the meso-pontine tegmental area)
	- Basal forebrain is the origin for acetylcholine in the forebrain
- Cholinergic axons give rise to an average of five collaterals, the majority of which have an ascending trajectory with a dorsal and ventral stream
	- Ascending ventral innervates parts of midbrain basal ganglia and continues to hypothalamic region in the basal forebrain
##### Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons
- GABAergic neurons are densely concentrated in the rostral PPN, forming a contiuum with GABAergic neurons of the [[Substantia Nigra pars reticular]] (SNr) and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (tail of [[Ventral Tegmental Area]])
- Glutamatergic neurons are more caudal and extend dorsally into the [[Cuneiform Nucleus]]

- One neuron innervates most of the ascending and descending pathways; however, rostral cholinergic neurons predominately innervate motor structures (SNc and dorsolateral striatum), whereas caudal portions innervate limbic structures (VTA and dorsomedial striatum)
	- Topographical organization resembles lateral-to-medial functional segregation of motor and limbic circuits
