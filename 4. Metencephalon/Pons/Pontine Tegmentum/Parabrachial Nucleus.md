- Integration site of homeostatic information - multimodal integration role unknown
- Visceral relay from [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]]
- Surrounds [[Superior Cerebellar Peduncle]]
- Extends to [[Periaqueductal Gray]]
- Taste, cardiovascular function, respiration, osmoregulation, thermoregulation, immune activation (inflammation), glucose balance, salt balance, salivation, gastrointestinal activity
- [['Spinothalamic Tract]] is contralateral whereas [[Trigeminal Sensory Nuclei]] is ipsilateral (though becomes contralateral for Thalamus)
### Afferents
- [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]]
- [['Lateral Spinothalamic Tract]] - Per A.D. Craig
### Efferents
Medial PB
- [[Ventroposterior Nucleus]], [[Mediodorsal Nucleus]] of [['Thalamus]]
Lateral PB
- [['Lateral Zone]], [['Medial Zone]], [[Dorsomedial]], [[Anterior]] of [['Hypothalamus]] <- Caudal [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]]
Subparabrachial <- Caudal [['Nucleus of the Solitary Tract]], regulates breathing
- [['Medulla Oblongata]]
- [['Spinal Cord]]
- [['Amygdala]] + Extended Amygdala
- [['Lateral Zone]]
