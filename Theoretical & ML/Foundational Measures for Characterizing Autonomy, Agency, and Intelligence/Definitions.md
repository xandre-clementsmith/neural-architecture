##### Command
src: accuracy, goal-directed
alt names: accuracy and precision
- Command: 
##### Communication
src: 
alt names: 
- Communication: Replication of organization across dimensions through information
	- Replication, not maintenance; information must be generated
##### Complexity
src:
alt names:
- Complexity: System measurement quantifying components and connections
	- Connection complexity can be measured by mathematical equation (linear vs nonlinear)
##### Control
src: precision
alt names: 
- Control:
##### Dimensions
src:
alt names: degrees of freedom
- Dimensions: Independent coordinates for defining the position of a point
	- Our day-to-day primarily consists of three spatial dimensions, and a temporal dimension
##### Entropy

alt names: Boltzmann's entropy formula
- Entropy: Measure of the number of possible microscopic states of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, consistent with its macroscopic thermodynamic properties
	- Microstates describe particle position and momentum
	- Macrostates describe total energy, volume, pressure, temperature, ...
##### Optimization
src: https://www.britannica.com/science/optimization
alt names: mathematical programming
- Optimization problems typically have three fundamental elements:
	- Objective Function: Single numerical quantity that is to be maximized or minimized
	- Independent Variables: Set of variables that can be manipulated to optimize the objective
	- Constraints: Restrictions on the values that the independent variables can take
##### Organization
src:
alt names:
- Organization: Description of complexity at  specific dimensions
##### Information
src: 
alt names: 
- Information: Description of complexity/organization; reduces uncertainty
##### Additional Definitions
- Cybernetics: Control and communication commanded by an agent; art of steersmanship
