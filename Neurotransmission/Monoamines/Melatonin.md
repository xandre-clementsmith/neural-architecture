Synthesized by [[Pineal Gland]]
- Released into CSF where it can interface with MT1 and MT2 receptors
- Functions: Hormone secretion, sleep promotion, reproductive activity rhythms, immune functionality, circadian rhythms, neuroprotective, pain-reducer, tumor suppressor, reproductive stimulant, and antioxidant
- Anti-excitatory
### Receptors
- MT1
	- Gi/o and Gq
	- [[Suprachiasmatic Hypothalamus]] MT1 receptors have an inhibitory effect on the brain promoting sleep
	- Also expressed in [[Anterior Pituitary]] and retina
- MT2
	- Gi/o
	- Inhibits Ca2+-dependent release of dopamine
	- Expressed in retina, and regulates bone depositing of osteoblasts
	- Phase shifts the internal circadian clock to entrain to Earth's light-dark cycle
	- Also expressed in suprachiasmatic
