# Receptors
### Ionotropic
- NMDA
	- Ligand-gated and voltage-gated leveraging Mg2+ and Zn2+ to gate Ca2+, Na+, and K+
	- Activated by glutamate and glycine (hindbrain-centric) or D-serine (forebrain-centric). Glycine and D-serine are present at relatively constant, ambient levels, but can increase to enable greater neurotransmission. These are produced by astrocytes.
	- Coincidence detector requiring real-time postsynpatic depolarization and recent presynaptic glutamate release
	- Subunits (4 Required):
		- GluN1: Required. Binds glycine or D-serine. 
		- GluN2: Binds glutamate
			- GluN2A: Low at birth increasing with development. Dominant in cortex and hippocampus. Fast kinetics, less Ca2+ permeable, lower glutamate affinity, less sensitive to Mg2+ block. Mature LTP. Reliable. 
			- GluN2B: High at birth. Remains high in PFC. Slow kinetics, more Ca2+ permeable, affinity to glutamate, and sensitive to Mg2+ block. Development plasticity but sensitive to excitotoxicity.
			- GluN2C: Cerebellar granule cells
			- GluN2D: Thalamus, brainstem, and immature neurons. Very slow kinetics.
- AMPA
	- Ligand-gated
	- Focused on signal/voltage transmission, not learning. (E.g. not permeable to Ca2+)
	- Added and removed by LTP and LTD
- Kainate
	- Ligand-gated
	- Largely support hippocampus and cerebellum
- Delta Receptors?
### Metabotropic
Belong to G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) C
- A/B/D/E GPCRs are significantly more common
- GPCR C includes mGluRs, GABA receptors, two groups of taste receptors, and a Ca2+-sensing receptor
- I (mGluR1/5)
	- Increase NMDA receptor activity and risk of excitotoxicity
	![[Pasted image 20251006234134.png]]
	- Gq -> Phospholipase C/Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate/diacylglycerol (PLC/IP3/DAG)
	- Moreso postsynaptic
- II (mGluR2/3)
	- Decrease NMDA receptor activity and risk of excitotoxicity
	- Gi -> ↓cAMP
	- Moreso presynaptic
- III (mGluR4/6/7/8)
	- Decrease NMDA receptor activity and risk of excitotoxicity
	- Gi -> ↓cAMP
	- Moreso presynaptic
