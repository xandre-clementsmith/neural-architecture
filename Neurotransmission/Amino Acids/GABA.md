Located throughout the CNS
# Receptors
### Ionotropic
GABA_A
- A cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel member, alongside nicotinic [[Acetylcholine (ACh)]], [[Glycine]], [[Serotonin (5-HT)]] 5-HT3, and Zinc-Activated Receptors
- Triggers chloride ion-selective pores
- Fast ISPS, order of ~1~ms
### Metabotropic
GABA_B
- Stimulates opening of K+ channels (hyperpolarization) and closing of Ca2+ channels, resulting in an inhibitory effect
- Slower than GABA_A, order of ~100ms
- Gi/o -> Decreases cAMP
