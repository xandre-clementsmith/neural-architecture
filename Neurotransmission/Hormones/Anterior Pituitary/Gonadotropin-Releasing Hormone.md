- Species-specific, and more distributed than most pituitary-terminating neurons
- Hypothalamic Infundibular Nucleus?
# Luteinizing Hormone
- Produced in [[Anterior Hypothalamus]]
- Controlled by Gonadotropic Cells, Reproductive Function
- Signal androgens (testosterone, etc) and hormonal precursors to estradiol (estrogen)
- Stimulated by high-frequency GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)
### Neuronal System
- Neurons are scattered throughout the septum and hypothalamus - Diffuse network that varies across species
	- [[Nucleus of the Diagonal Band]]
	- [[Medial Septal Nucleus]]
	- [[Medial Preoptic Area, Hypothalamus]], [[Lateral Preoptic Area]]
	- [[Anterior Hypothalamus]], Ventrolateral (Primates)
- Ignores much of the medial preoptic area and suprachiasmatic nuclei
- Four diffuse tracts to [[Median Eminence]]
- Concentrated in lateral median eminence
- Relatively few neurons, with about 2400 in the baboon
### Males
- Acts on leydig cells of the testis that produce testosterone
- Moderately tied to sexual arousal
- Male estrogen arises from the enzyme aromatase by testosterone conversion
### Females
- Stimulates ovarian theca cells that provide androgens and precursors to estradiol
- Surge in LH results in ovulation
- Very similar to human chorionic gonadotropin, released by the placenta during pregnancy
- Female testosterone is produced as precursor to estrogen
### Androgens / Testosterone

# Follicle-Stimulating Hormone
- Produced in [[Anterior Pituitary]]
- Gonadotropic Cell, Reproductive Function
- Enhanced by activin, and inhibited by inhibin
- Stimulated by low-frequency GnRH 
### Neuronal System
- Shared system with [[Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone]] leveraging GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)
### Male
- Central Function: Sperm Production
- Stimulates maturation of primordial germ cells (-> gametes/sperm)
- Induces Sertoli cells (in testes) to secrete androgen-binding proteins (ABPs), which bind to free androgens and estrogens in the tubular fluid and support spermatogenesis
	- The relative binding affinity of various sex steroids for SHBG is dihydrotestosterone (DHT) > testosterone > androstenediol > estradiol > estrone
	- DHT binds to SHBG with about 5 times the affinity of testosterone and about 20 times the affinity of estradiol
	- Results in negative feedback loop via release of inhibin
### Female
- Stimulates maturation of primordial germ cells (-> gametes/egg -> follicle)
- Initiates granulosa/follicular cell growth, which supports the gamete/oocyte/egg
	- Follicular Phase of Menstrual Cycle: Converts androgens to estradiol
	- Post-Ovulation: Granulosa -> Granulosa Lutein, which produce progesterone
- As inhibin levels rise, FSH levels decline in the late follicle stage, selecting the most advanced follicle for ovulation
