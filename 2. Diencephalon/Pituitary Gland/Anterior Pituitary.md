### Hormones
- Growth Hormone (GH): Secreted from somatotrophs, which compromise about half of anterior pituitary cells
	- -> Muscles -> IGF
- Prolactin (PRL): Secreted by lactotrophs, making up 15-20% of anterior pituitary cells
- Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone: Control the gonads, making up 10% of anterior pituitary cells
	- -> Gonads -> Gonadal Hormones
- Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): Secreted by thyrtrophs and controls thyroids with %5 of anterior pituitary cells
	- -> Thyroid -> T3, T4
- Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH): Controls glucocorticoid function via the corticotrophs, comprising 15% of anterior pituitary cells
	- -> Adrenals -> Corticosteroids
- Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH)
