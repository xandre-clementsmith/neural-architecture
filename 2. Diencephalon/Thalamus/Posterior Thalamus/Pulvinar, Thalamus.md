- Visually-focused region?
- High inter-cortex connectivity
- 40% of thalamus in humans - virtually non-existent in rats
- Connectivity seems to include visual cortex and superior colliculi; hard to find consolidated afferents and efferents
- Seems to be used for visual processing and dorsal attention
