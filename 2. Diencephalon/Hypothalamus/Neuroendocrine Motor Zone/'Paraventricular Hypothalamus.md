Location: Periventricular Zone, runs rostrocaudally through anterior region into tuberal region

Function: Fluid balance, milk let-down, parturition, autonomic & anterior pituitary control

- Single most important hypothalamic nucleus of the central autonomic network. Supported by Dorsomedial, Lateral Hypothalamic Area, Posterior Hypothalamic, and Mammillary. Supporting nuclei are bilaterally connected to the PVN, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the central grey matter, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral and ventral medulla, and the intermediolateral spinal columns. 

Morphological Functional Categories
- Magnocellular/Big Neurons: Vasopressin and Oxycotin
	- Project axons into posterior pituitary
- Two Subsets of Parvocellular/Small Neurons
	1. A neuroendocrine-related functional subset that project to the median eminence and secrete releasing hormones into the hypophyseal portal blood stream for control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion
	2. A central autonomic control subset

Pre-Autonomic Parvocellular Neurons
- Pre-autonomic PVN neurons projects directly onto preganglionic autonomic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the autonomic relay nuclei of the brainstem (A5, rostral ventral lateral medulla), and even directly to the intermediolateral spinal columns
- Type A:
- Type B:
- Type C:

Additional Info
- PVN receives direct sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs from trigeminal pars caudalis (sympathetic) and nucleus of the solitary tract (parasympathetic)
