ANS: Autonomic Nervous System
NES: Neuroendocrine System

- Most hypothalamic connections are bi-directional

### Connectivity

Afferents (Primarily located in the anterior hypothalamus):
- Limbic System
	- Medial Forebrain Bundle: Descending olfactory and septal areas (ascending amygdaloid and substantia innominata)
	- Stria Terminalis: Amygdaloid Complex
	- Fornix: Hippocampus
- Brainstem Reticular Formation
	- Dorsal Longitudinal Fasciculus
	- Periventricular Fiber System
	- Median Forebrain Bundle
- Thalamus
	- Median Thalamus
	- Medial Thalamus
- Subthalamus
	- Nucleus Subthalamicus and Zona Incerta
- Basal Ganglia
	- Nucleus Accumbens
	- Substantia Innominata
- Retina
	- Circadian Rhythms via retino-hypothalamic tract into suprachiasmatic
- Neocortex via medial forebrain bundle

# Anatomy
### Zones

![[Pasted image 20240210143754.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240210143538.png]]

- Periventricular: Few nuclei; includes arcuate and periventricular nuclei for neuroendocrine and autonomic regulation
	- Paraventricular and arcuate
- Medial: Majority of nuclei
- Lateral: Few nuclei; important fibre pathways, such as median forebrain bundle. Regulation of autonomic
	- Lateral tuberal complex and pieces of preoptic and supraoptic

### Regions

![[Pasted image 20240210144234.png]]

- Zones are divided by lamina terminalis/optic chiasm -> anterior -> tuberal -> posterior/mammillary bodies

### Nuclei

- Nuclei are covered in sub-pages of Hypothalamus

- However, exceptions above the average are more pronounced for contralateral heterotopic macroconnections, and most notable are four with a weight of 7 (very strong): ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLP) to tuberomammillary nucleus (TM), LHA juxtadorsomedial region (LHAjd) to dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd), LHA subfornical region anterior zone to PMd, and retina to suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCH). In contrast, the strongest hypothalamic homotopic macroconnections each have a weight of 4 (weak to moderate) and are formed by the following four regions: parastrial nucleus, SCH, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (ARH), and ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv).

Hypothalamic Divisions
- (_i_) a neuroendocrine motor zone associated with pituitary gland control; 
- (_ii_) medial zone nuclei forming part of a putative behavior control column; 
- (_iii_) a highly interconnected group of five rostrally located regions and the three regions of the DMH that together are considered to form a theoretical “visceromotor network” for generating patterned autonomic and neuroendocrine motor output; 
- (_iv_) a periventricular region related to (and possibly expanding) the visceromotor network, defined essentially by what remains of the periventricular and medial zones after subtracting the neuroendocrine motor zone, medial zone nuclei, and visceromotor network; and 
- (_v_) a lateral zone associated prominently with the behavior control column, which is supported by more recent data

- HY2 subsystems largely follows the five divisions of the earlier model
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.1 including (and mostly composed of) all regions of the neuroendocrine (i) motor zone and the visceromotor network (iii)
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.2 mostly composed of medial zone nuclei (behavior control column; ii), the periventricular region (iv), and the lateral zone (v)
