# Anatomy - Macroscale Intrinsic Network Architecture

Hypothalamic Divisions
- (_i_) a neuroendocrine motor zone associated with pituitary gland control; 
- (_ii_) medial zone nuclei forming part of a putative behavior control column; 
- (_iii_) a highly interconnected group of five rostrally located regions and the three regions of the DMH that together are considered to form a theoretical “visceromotor network” for generating patterned autonomic and neuroendocrine motor output; 
- (_iv_) a periventricular region related to (and possibly expanding) the visceromotor network, defined essentially by what remains of the periventricular and medial zones after subtracting the neuroendocrine motor zone, medial zone nuclei, and visceromotor network; and 
- (_v_) a lateral zone associated prominently with the behavior control column, which is supported by more recent data

- HY2 subsystems largely follows the five divisions of the earlier model
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.1 including (and mostly composed of) all regions of the neuroendocrine (i) motor zone and the visceromotor network (iii)
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.2 mostly composed of medial zone nuclei (behavior control column; ii), the periventricular region (iv), and the lateral zone (v)
