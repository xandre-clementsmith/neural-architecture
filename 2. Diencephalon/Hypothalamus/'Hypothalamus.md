# Anatomy - Macroscale Intrinsic Network Architecture

Hypothalamic Divisions
- (_i_) a neuroendocrine motor zone associated with pituitary gland control; 
- (_ii_) medial zone nuclei forming part of a putative behavior control column; 
- (_iii_) a highly interconnected group of five rostrally located regions and the three regions of the DMH that together are considered to form a theoretical “visceromotor network” for generating patterned autonomic and neuroendocrine motor output; 
- (_iv_) a periventricular region related to (and possibly expanding) the visceromotor network, defined essentially by what remains of the periventricular and medial zones after subtracting the neuroendocrine motor zone, medial zone nuclei, and visceromotor network; and 
- (_v_) a lateral zone associated prominently with the behavior control column, which is supported by more recent data

- HY2 subsystems largely follows the five divisions of the earlier model
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.1 including (and mostly composed of) all regions of the neuroendocrine (i) motor zone and the visceromotor network (iii)
	- HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.2 mostly composed of medial zone nuclei (behavior control column; ii), the periventricular region (iv), and the lateral zone (v)

- Rostral (Red): Circuits regulating the three basic classes of goal-oriented behavior common to all animals: ingestive, reproductive, and defensive
- Caudal (Black): Plays a critical role in circuits underlying the expression of exploratory or foraging behavior

- Overall, this organization suggests a prominent functional association for HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.1 with physiological control (especially neuroendocrine signaling), and for subsystem 1.2 with behavioral control (especially somatomotor signaling). Moreover, primacy of physiological control is suggested by inclusion of all four candidate hubs in HY2 M1/2 subsystem 1.1 (white asterisks). However, both HY2 top-level subsystems 1.1 and 1.2 include regions involved in autonomic and behavioral-state control, and the existence of only two bilateral HY2 top-level modules underscores deep intrahypothalamic integration. Communication between HY2 M1/2 subsystems 1.1 and 1.2 may be considered mutually supportive, and both support the prime function of the hypothalamus to support survival and sexual reproduction.
