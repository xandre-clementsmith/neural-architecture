# Function
- Primary Gustatory Cortex: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726647/ 
- Viscero-Sensory, Nociceptive-Thermoreceptive Cortices
	- Interoception: Perception of bodily states
	- Relay and integrates information about blood pressure and oxygenation, motility of digestion system, timing and strength of the heartbeat, pain, hunger, nausea, tickle, itch, pleasant touch, and other bodily sensations.
	- Projects to [['Lateral Zone]], [[Parabrachial Nucleus]], and [[Solitary Nucleus]] to regular heartbeat, blood pressure, and gastric motility
- Emotional Processing: Anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, disgust, happiness, trust, surprise, and social emotions. 
- Sensation Valuation: E.g., flavor recognition and taste aversion, identify pain as bad (pain asymbolia) <- potentially maps multimodal sensation onto valence maps
- Vestibular Cortex
- Component of [[Salience Network]]

# Structure
- Divided between [[Anterior Insular]] and [[Posterior Insular]]
- Cytoarchitecture is divided into granular, dysgranular, and agranular
- Contains von Economo neurons unique to humans, great apes, elephants, and some cetaceans
- Contains visceral insular cortex, gustatory cortex, insular auditory cortex, and somatosensory fields; these are multimodal integration sites, not just sensory processing regions

### Afferents
- Thalamic and cortical afferents for auditory, somatosensory, olfactory, gustatory, visual, and interoceptive information
- Lateral and basolateral [['Amygdala]] project to granular and dysgranular regions
- [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]]
- [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]]
- [[Medial Prefrontal Cortex]]
- [[Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis]]
- [[Mediodorsal Nucleus]]
- [['Lateral Zone]] of [['Hypothalamus]]
- [[Parahippocampal Cortex]] including [[Perirhinal Cortex]] and [['Entorhinal Cortex]]
- Input from [[Acetylcholine]], [[Dopamine (DA)]], [[Serotonin (5-HT)]], and [[Norepinephrine]] systems

### Efferents
- Granular and dysgranular regions project to basolateral, lateral, and central [['Amygdala]] nuclei
- [[Anterior Cingulate Cortex]]
- [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]]
- [[Medial Prefrontal Cortex]]
- [[Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis]]
- [[Mediodorsal Nucleus]]
- [['Lateral Zone]] of [['Hypothalamus]]
- [[Parahippocampal Cortex]] including [[Perirhinal Cortex]] and [['Entorhinal Cortex]]
- [[Nucleus Accumbens]]
- [[Caudate Nucleus]] and [[Putamen]]
