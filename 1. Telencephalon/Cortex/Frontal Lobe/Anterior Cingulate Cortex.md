- Component of [[Salience Network]]
	- Only ACC and [['Insular Cortex]] have Von Economo neurons
- Connects cognitive frontal cortex to emotional limbic system

# Function
- Cingulate motor areas translate internal and external states (e.g. emotional states) into motor commands for primary and supplementary motor cortices and spinal cord

# Structure
### Connectivity
- General Limbic Connectivity
	- Emotions: [['Amygdala]]
	- Autonomic: [['Lateral Zone]] [['Hypothalamus]]
	- Reward: [[Orbitofrontal Cortex]], [[Nucleus Accumbens]]
