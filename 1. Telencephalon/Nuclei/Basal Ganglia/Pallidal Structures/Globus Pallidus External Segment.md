- Lateral Globus Pallidus
### Afferents
- Cortex, Subcortical Structures, Amygdala, Thalamus, Hypothalamus, and Brainstem
### Neurons
Prototypic
- Spike at high frequencies and project to BG nuclei alongside thalamus and cortex
- Express Nk2 homeobox 1 and subpopulations express parvalbumin and LIM homeobox protein 6
- Synapse onto other prototypic and arkypallidal neurons (~1.15% connectivity for prototypic-to-protoctypic)
Arkypallidal
- Express forkhead protein 2, neuronal PAS domain protein 1, and precursor preproenkephalin
- Less active and project strong and immediate inhibitory signals to striatum
- Slower and larger action potentials, higher input resistance, lower spontaneous firing rates, and larger sag ratios
