- Shell projects to lateral hypothalamus, and seems to be critical to classical conditioning. Core does not project to lateral hypothalamus and is more critical to operant conditioning.
- Parahippocampal dominates core, hippocampal domaintes shell. Ventral hippocampus (viscerolimbic) projects caudomedially, and dorsal hippocampal areas (spatial) project to lateral parts of rostral shell and core
- Shell ~ 50-70% of volume; Core ~ 30-50% of volume, but hard to say
- Opioid hedonic hotspot (rostrodorsal quadrant of medial shell / dorsomedial dorsal tip) ~ 30% of medial shell, 10% of entire nucleus accumbens
# Connectivity
Rostrodorsal Quadrant of Medial Shell
Afferents
- BA25 (Infralimbic) / [[Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex]] in Humans
- [[Subiculum]], Ventral via Precommissural [[Fornix]]
- [[Basomedial Amygdala]]
- [[B6 - Dorsal Raphe Nuclei]]
- [[Interfascicular Nucleus]] of the [[A10 - Ventral Tegmental Area]]
Efferents (Possibly Single Axons Bifurcating)
- [[Ventral Pallidum]] (Substantia Innominata "dmt-recipient")
- [[Lateral Hypothalamic Area, Anterior]]

No afferent seem to only target a part of the nucleus accumbens - moreso it's about afferent distribution
