### Divisions
1. Dorsolateral (sensorimotor) or dorsomedial (associative/cognitive) ventral (limbic)
2. Matrix to pallidum or striosome patch to dopamine neurons
3. Project direct to GPi/SNr (D1) or indirect to GPe (D2-like)
	- For ventral, it either projects direct to dopamine neurons, or to ventral pallidum (which has both direct and indirect paths)

Info
- Striatum: GABAergic Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs) of the [[Striatopallidonigral Bundle]]
	- Integrates up to 5,000-10,000 cortical neurons per MSN
	- MSNs then project out of striatum
	- Express wide variety of AMPA, NMDA, and mGluRs along dendritic spines and shafts where cortical inputs are located (though most GluRs and significant AMPA/NMDA receptors are localized extrasynaptically)
	- Direct MSNs express D1-like receptors and project to GPi
	- Indirect MSNs express D2-like receptors and project to GPe
	- 95% MSNs. 5% cholinergic interneurons
	- Hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials and strong inward rectification
- Separated into striosome (high mu-opioid patches), and matrix
	- Matrix region projects to GPe, SNr dorsally, VP ventrally
	- Matrix is enriched with calbindin, somatostatin, enkephalin, DA2-receptor, acaetylcholine esterase and choline acetyltransferase, 
	- Striosome (10-15%) projects to SNc dorsally, VTA ventrally
	- Striosomes are enriched with high levels of mu-opioid receptor, substance P, dopamine 1-receptor, met-enkephalin, calretinin, Nr4a1, pro-dynrophin, GAD-2, and EGR-1
- For ventral system:
	- Both D1 and D2 MSNs go to both ventral mesencephalon ([[A8 - Retrorubal Field]], [[A9 - Substantia Nigra pars compacta]], [[A10 - Ventral Tegmental Area]]) and ventral pallidum
	- Ventral pallidum branches off into indirect path to ventral mesencephalon, and direct path to thalamus


"Although the general neurophysiological character-
istics are uniform throughout the striatum, dorsal–
ventral differences do exist. They concern more subtle,
fine-tuned physiological neuronal properties. Dopamine
attenuates glutamatergic inputs to the ventral but not to
the dorsal striatum in vitro by a presynaptic mechanism
involving D1 -like receptors [40,41]. In dorsal striatum,
dopamine receptors attenuate AMPA-receptor-mediated
input but enhance NMDA-receptor-mediated input
by a postsynaptic mechanism involving voltage-gated
Ca2þ channels [42]. This combination of actions does not
occur in the ventral striatum [40,41]. Furthermore, both
striatal regions can sustain long-term synaptic plasticity
under particular protocols: high-frequency tetanization of
corticostriatal inputs in vitro induces long-term poten-
tiation in the ventral striatum but long-term depression in
the dorsal striatum [43,44]. These differences might not
only be intrinsic to postsynaptic neural elements but also
depend on the properties of afferent pathways differen-
tially innervating dorsal and ventral striatum."
