# neural-architecture
Currently working to understand the structure/neuroanatomy of the brain to locate key areas relevant to AI alignment. Notes are meant to be traversed via Obsidian.

Please note that these notes are not uniform and references are sporadic at best. These primarily serve to bolster my internal model of the brain, rather than serve as an abstracted atlas for community use.
