# Sensation

Types of Sensors
- Thermoreceptors
- Mechanoreceptors
	- Proprioceptors
	- Nociceptors (Not always mechanoreceptors)
- Chemoreceptors (Including Metaboreceptors)
- Photoreceptors

Spinocerebellar carries a variety of somatosensory, so has not been specifically called out below

A (heavily myelinated), B (moderately myelinated), C (unmyelinated)
alpha (largest), beta (large), gamma (medium), delta (small)
- Aα (Proprioception)
	- Ia (Proprioception): Detect changes in muscle length
	- Ib (Prioprioception): Tension at junction of muscle and tendon
- Aβ/II (Cutaneous Mechanoreceptors, DCML except maybe partially hair follicles):
	- SA1 (Slowly Adapting): Sustained pressure via the Merkel corpuscle end-organ. Sensation of form and roughness on the skin, light touch, as well as sharp edges. Most sensitive mechanoreceptors to vibrations. Sustained response to static stimuli
	- SA2 (Slowly Adapting): Ruffini corpuscle end-organ. Not extremely clear, but likely pressure and skin stretch
	- RA (Rapidly Adapting): Transient response of Meissner corpuscle end-organs. Light touch, flutter, slip. Most prominent on fingertips
	- Pacinian Corpuscle: Transient vibration and deep pressure. Involved in proprioception. Present in skin on surfaces of hands, feet, arms, and neck. Found on bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas, breast, genitals, and lymph nodes
	- Hair Root Plexuses: Light touch and subtle movement (Maybe innervated by C fibers? Exteroceptive regardless)
	- Maybe Krause end bulbs? Conflicting information about what these convey
- Aδ/III (Free Nerve Endings - Spinothalamic): 
	- Fast pain nociceptors
	- Light poorly localized touch? (anterior spinothalamic)
	- Warmth and cool thermoreceptors (faster conduction)
	- Pressure
- B (Autonomic): General Visceral Afferent fibers over Spinothalamic
- C: 
	- Slow pain nociceptors
	- Warmth thermoreceptors (low conduction)
	- Ultra-slow histamine-selective fibers for itch
	- Tactile C Fibers
		- Sensual touch (Positive affect)
		- Light poorly localized touch? (Anterior spinothalamic)
	- Mechano/metabo-receptors in muscles or joints for muscle burn or cramp
	- Metaboreceptors

Small-diameter: temperature, mechanical stress or damage, local metabolism (acidic pH or protons, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, hypo-osmolarity, lactic acid, ATP), cell rupture (ATP, glutamate), cutaneous parasite penetration (histamine, proteinases), mast cell activation (serotonin, bradykinin, eicosanoids), immune and hormonal activity (cytokines, somatostatin), and safe, conspecific contact
