- Produced in [[Anterior Pituitary]]
- Gonadotropic Cell, Reproductive Function
- Enhanced by activin, and inhibited by inhibin
- Stimulated by low-frequency GnRH 
### Neuronal System
- Shared system with [[Luteinizing Hormone]] leveraging GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)
### Male
- Central Function: Sperm Production
- Stimulates maturation of primordial germ cells (-> gametes/sperm)
- Induces Sertoli cells (in testes) to secrete androgen-binding proteins (ABPs), which bind to free androgens and estrogens in the tubular fluid and support spermatogenesis
	- The relative binding affinity of various sex steroids for SHBG is dihydrotestosterone (DHT) > testosterone > androstenediol > estradiol > estrone
	- DHT binds to SHBG with about 5 times the affinity of testosterone and about 20 times the affinity of estradiol
	- Results in negative feedback loop via release of inhibin
### Female
- Stimulates maturation of primordial germ cells (-> gametes/egg -> follicle)
- Initiates granulosa/follicular cell growth, which supports the gamete/oocyte/egg
	- Follicular Phase of Menstrual Cycle: Converts androgens to estradiol
	- Post-Ovulation: Granulosa -> Granulosa Lutein, which produce progesterone
- As inhibin levels rise, FSH levels decline in the late follicle stage, selecting the most advanced follicle for ovulation
