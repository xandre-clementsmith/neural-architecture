- Produced in [[Anterior Pituitary]]
- Controls thyroid
- Triggers thyroid hormone production, including triiodthyronine (T3) and thyroxine/tetraiodothyronine (T4)
### Neuronal System
- Direct Afferents (Periventricular & Paraventricular)
	- [[Medial Preoptic Area, Hypothalamus]]
	- [[Paraventricular Hypothalamus]], Parvicellular
- TRH Neurons
	- [[Diagonal Band of Broca]]
	- [[Medial Preoptic Hypothalamus]]
	- [[Paraventricular Hypothalamus]], Parvicellular
	- [[Lateral Hypothalamus]]
	- [[Dorsomedial Hypothalamus]]
	- [[Arcuate Hypothalamus]], Posterior
	- [[Premammillary Hypothalamus]]
### Function
- Increases basal metabolic rate, including appetite, absorption of substances, and gut motility
- Increases rate and strength of heartbeat, rate of breathing, intake and consumption of oxygen, and increase mitochondria activity, resulting in increased blood flow and body temperature
- Increase growth rate in development, including brain development
- Maintaining normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns
