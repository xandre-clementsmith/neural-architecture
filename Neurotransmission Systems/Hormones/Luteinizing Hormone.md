- Produced in [[Anterior Hypothalamus]]
- Gonadotropic Cell, Reproductive Function
- Signal androgens (testosterone, etc) and hormonal precursors to estradiol (estrogen)
- Stimulated by high-frequency GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone)
### Neuronal System
- Neurons are scattered throughout the septum and hypothalamus - Diffuse network that varies across species
	- [[Nucleus of the Diagonal Band]]
	- [[Medial Septal Nucleus]]
	- [[Medial Preoptic Area, Hypothalamus]], [[Lateral Preoptic Area]]
	- [[Anterior Hypothalamus]], Ventrolateral (Primates)
- Ignores much of the medial preoptic area and suprachiasmatic nuclei
- Four diffuse tracts to [[Median Eminence]]
- Concentrated in lateral median eminence
- Relatively few neurons, with about 2400 in the baboon
### Males
- Acts on leydig cells of the testis that produce testosterone
- Moderately tied to sexual arousal
- Male estrogen arises from the enzyme aromatase by testosterone conversion
### Females
- Stimulates ovarian theca cells that provide androgens and precursors to estradiol
- Surge in LH results in ovulation
- Very similar to human chorionic gonadotropin, released by the placenta during pregnancy
- Female testosterone is produced as precursor to estrogen
