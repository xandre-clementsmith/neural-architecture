- First, fibers from the adjacent regions of cortex that travel short distances (or not at all) anterio-posteriorly within the cingulum bundle must nevertheless cross through it in order to reach their targets. From a connectivity approach, we would not consider these to be properly part of the cingulum bundle, but they cannot be ignored because of their shared volumes. 
- Second, the bundle contains anterio-posteriorly directed cingulate fibers: those emanating from the cingulate, those traveling to the cingulate, and both. 
- Third, there are some fibers traveling long distances within the cingulum bundle with no relationship to the cingulate cortex itself.
