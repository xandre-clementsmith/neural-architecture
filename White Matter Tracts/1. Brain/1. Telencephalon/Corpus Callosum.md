- Projects to homotopically (mirror image), as well as to cortical and some subcortical regions heterotopically in accordance with ipsilateral patterning
![[Pasted image 20250827231833.png]]
- Topographic
- Strong homotopical targets (mirror image location)
- Secondary heterotopical targets (contralateral) with same region and strength as ipsilateral connectivity
	- Primarily cortex
	- Secondarily striatum and claustrum, likely not thalamus
