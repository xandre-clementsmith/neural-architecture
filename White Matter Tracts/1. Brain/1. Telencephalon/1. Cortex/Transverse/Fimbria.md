- Includes fimbria principal part, alveus, dorsal fornix, and hippocampal commissures
Per Wikipedia:
- White myelinated fibers that cover the _ventricular (deep)_ parts of hippocampus make **alveus**.
- Fibers that cover the _temporal_ parts of hippocampus make a fiber bundle that is called **fimbria**. Going from temporal to septal (dorsal) parts of hippocampus fimbria collects more and more hippocampal and subicular outputs and becomes thicker.
- In the _midline_ and under the corpus callosum, these fibers form the fornix
