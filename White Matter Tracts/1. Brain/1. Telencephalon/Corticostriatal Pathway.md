- Leverages External Capsule and Muratoff's Bundle
- Arise from medium sized pyramidal neurons in layer III and layer V [['Telencephalon]]
- In rats, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in striatum receive approximately 5000 cortical inputs forming asymmetric synapses almost exclusively on spine heads

# Misc
- In rodents, corticostriatal neurons are categorized according to IT and PT, but primate PT neurons do not seem to innervate striatum:
	- Intratelencephalic (IT) - Layer III, Upper Layer V
	- Pyramidal Tract (PT) - Lower Layer V that descend to brainstem and spinal cord with thin axon collaterals that innervate the striatum
