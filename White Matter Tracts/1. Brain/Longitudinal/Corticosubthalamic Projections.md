- [[Corticosubthalamic Projections]]: Arise primarily from Layer V, ipsilaterally
- Projections give rise to sparse population of terminals forming asymmetric synapses only with distal dendrites of [['Subthalamic Nuclei]]

Src:
- Complex synaptic mechanisms and membrane properties of STN neurons have been suggested to explain how sparse, distally located cortical inputs could mediate powerful excitatory effects upon STN neurons despite the massive and tonically active inhibitory influences from the GPe (Bevan et al., [2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3149683/#B14), [2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3149683/#B13)).
